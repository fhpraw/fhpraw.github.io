My name is **Fajar Hari Prabowo**, Long name huh!? It might be really hard to pronounce, so never mind.

I just want to transfer my memories into digital scripts, forever, here. This keeping me on track for finding some materials, such as tutorials, messages, poetries, or whatever it is which I can't memorize them all but they are important.

Sometimes I write in [Bahasa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_language), some of you guys can't understand, only Indonesian folks know the meaning.

## Who am I

Introvert, anti-social, love to watch anime then people call me a weaboo? Apparently, nope. I just an ordinary guy, who work at ordinary office with super patient-challenging, repetitive, boring situation with massive workload and variative jobdesc. But, for some reason I love to work with them.

I think all of you guys should learn their culture. Taking care each other, no blackmailing, no bad mouthing, no negative thinking, all is about to serve as best as we can, being one as a team. How beautiful workplace is, isn't it ...

I live with my lovely mom and dad at small house, downtown. They take care of me, even at almost my third decades. what am I doing??? Of course, I do my part, being a good son, make some cash, supporting our needs even it considered a little help.

I know it, I am struggling to make my dreams come true. Some of you are lucky, it's easy to make ten grands annually, but not me. I stuck at 100 bucks a month, can you imagine that. So that, makes me hard to get marry with someone I love. She is kind, beautiful, shy, a good teacher at university. But, unfortunately, she dumps me, sad.

Chance to meet different people is rare enough. I sit on the chair, face to the monitor, meet the same person, every single day. repeat...

Hopefully, I meet a beautiful Japanese Wife (you guys don't be such a weaboo). I mean it, not for playing thing, I should get marry as soon as possible. You guys want to be a single person for the rest of your life? No, I am not with you. I don't want to be a forever alone guy. Melancholist am I? Have three or four children, make my own big family. Happy !!!

## What am I doing

Push some random codes on github, checking messages, emails, do stuff in front of desk, meet same people, meet some rascal students, but there are kindly students too. Being nice with boss and his guest, having fun with my team at office. Make new story and experience, having a new skills like programming, design, organize my workspace, adapting with different people, multitasking job, and bunch of new things. This is an era of difficult life. You couldn't eat if you don't want do many things at the same time.
